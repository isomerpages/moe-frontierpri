<p>Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) are an important aspect of a child&rsquo;s growing years in education. The CCA experience plays a substantive part of a child&rsquo;s holistic development in school. The school has implemented an approach introducing the concept of CCAs to our students through our P3 SCCA programme which provides them with a broad-based exposure in the domains of physical, cognitive and the aesthetic.</p>
<p>CCAs offer students a unique experience not found in the normal classroom-based lessons and students will be presented with the opportunity to take on various leadership and mentoring roles in the course of their CCA participation, which we are confident will enhance their overall primary school experience.</p>
<p>It is through CCAs, where students will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discover their interests and talents</li>
<li>Develop their skills and hone their talents in a CCA of their choosing,</li>
<li>Have the opportunity to specialize / participate at a competitive level.</li>
</ul>
<p>From 2019, Primary 3 students will select and participate in CCAs. Frontier Primary School currently offers the following CCAs (<em>You may click on the CCA in the table to find out more.)</em></p>
