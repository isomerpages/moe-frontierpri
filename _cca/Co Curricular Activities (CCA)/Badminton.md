<p>Badminton is a very enjoyable sport played by many people all around the
world. The rules are not complicated and it is a fairly easy game to learn.
Badminton can be played either casually or competitively. During badminton
lessons, students will learn the proper way to serve and maintaining a
rally with an opponent using several variations of hitting the shuttle
over the net. Quick-thinking is also a pre-requisite of a good badminton
player. Students who demonstrate great potential would be shortlisted for
advance training and have the opportunity to represent the school if we
decide to participate in the Zonal competition.</p>
