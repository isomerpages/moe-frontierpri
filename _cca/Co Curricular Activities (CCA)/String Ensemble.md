<p>Frontier Primary String Ensemble (FPSE) is established in 2014. It caters
to the needs of students with a love for music and plays a complementary
role in enriching the school’s music programmes. It is also the school’s
representative group that performs at different platforms. It introduces
students to the fundamentals of music theory and technical aspects of the
instruments in the string family----violin, viola, cello or double bass.</p>
<p>The ensemble, under the baton and leadership of our main conductor, Ms
Stella who is the founder and music director of International W&amp;Y Music
School 2005. Together with her, is a team of high-level international professional
musicians.</p>
<p>As this CCA is applicable for P3-P6 students with music / violin or cello
background, P1-P2 interested participants could enrol themselves in Violin/Cello
Enrichment Class to build up their foundation in string-instrument-playing
(<strong>Registration for existing VEP/CEP members is always at the end of the same year. Registration for new VEP/CEP members will be at Term 1 of the year. More details will be sent via PG.)</strong>
</p>
<p>Each newly joined member (VEP/CEP/CCA) will need to prepare a black file
on their own for scores keeping. They would also need to purchase or rent
their own instruments.</p>
