<p>Frontier Basketball CCA endeavors to complement the academic programmes
of the school to provide our students with a holistic education in the
physical domain. All members will have regular practices and there is a
structured progressive training from basic to advance to equip students
with the necessary skills to enjoy the game.</p>
<p>Through the regular trainings and friendly games, basketball members will
have the opportunities to develop their leadership skill, teamwork and
sportsmanship. Members will also understand the importance of perseverance
and resilience through trainings and we hope that they will bring and apply
these values beyond the basketball court to their lives.</p>
