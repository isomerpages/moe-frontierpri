<td><strong>CCA Information:</strong></td>
<td>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Art and Crafts CCA</strong>&nbsp;gathers students with interest in the visual arts to come together and learn more about art. Throughout the year, students are exposed to various forms and mediums to enhance creativity and self-expression. Ceramics, painting, illustration and printmaking are just some examples of what the students might learn.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Art and Crafts CCA</strong>&nbsp;provides a platform for students to showcase their talent beyond the curriculum. Learning journeys to museum and art workshops expose students to build appreciation and awareness of art beyond the school. Opportunities to represent the school in various Art Competitions will be a common affair.</p>
