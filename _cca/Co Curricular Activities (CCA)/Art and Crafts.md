<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Art and Crafts CCA</strong>&nbsp;gathers students with
interest in the visual arts to come together and learn more about art.
Throughout the year, students are exposed to various forms and mediums
to enhance creativity and self-expression. Ceramics, painting, illustration
and printmaking are just some examples of what the students might learn.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Art and Crafts CCA</strong>&nbsp;provides a platform
for students to showcase their talent beyond the curriculum. Learning journeys
to museum and art workshops expose students to build appreciation and awareness
of art beyond the school. Opportunities to represent the school in various
Art Competitions will be a common affair.</p>
