<p>Rugby provides an opportunity for students who are not in sports or uniformed
groups to experience and develop movement skills for physical competence
through an active lifestyle by their involvement in the game. The Primary
4 students will go through the fundamentals of Tag/Touch Rugby before joining
the Primary 5 in doing contact Rugby.</p>
<p>Our teachers believe in teaching the students sportsmanship and character
values through the sport and also foster many new friendships through the
game which develops the personal and interpersonal skills that encourage
them to work as a team and display attributes which reflect positive teamwork
characteristics.</p>
