<td width="177"><strong>CCA Information:</strong></td>
<td width="425">Rugby provides an opportunity for students who are not in sports or uniformed groups to experience and develop movement skills for physical competence through an active lifestyle by their involvement in the game. The Primary 4 students will go through the fundamentals of Tag/Touch Rugby before joining the Primary 5 in doing contact Rugby.
<p>Our teachers believe in teaching the students sportsmanship and character values through the sport and also foster many new friendships through the game which develops the personal and interpersonal skills that encourage them to work as a team and display attributes which reflect positive teamwork characteristics.</p>
