<p>Modern Dance, formerly known as DanzWhiz, started out as special talent
identification programme for lower primary boys. After participating in
an audition and undergoing a talent dance programme, these boys were shortlisted
to represent Frontier Primary School in the 2016 Singapore Youth Festival
(SYF) Arts Presentation for Dance (International Dance) category. Through
their hard work and determination, they clinched the Distinction Award,
the highest accolade for the school. They were amongst the youngest participants
and had won the hearts of many with their contagious energy and passion
while they were dancing on the stage.</p>
<p>Presently, it has evolved to a CCA where members come to explore the various
genres and dance techniques of modern dance, hip hop and street dance while
learning about confidence, discipline and teamwork.</p>
