<p><strong>The Modern Dance CCA Journey at Frontier</strong>
</p>
<p>What began as a special talent programme just for lower primary boys has
blossomed into one of Frontier Primary’s most exciting and inclusive CCAs
today — <strong>Modern Dance</strong>!</p>
<p>Formerly known as <em>DanzWhiz</em>, the programme first took flight with
a group of talented young boys who auditioned and trained hard under a
dedicated dance mentorship. Their efforts paid off spectacularly when they
represented Frontier Primary School in the <strong>2016 Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation</strong> under
the International Dance category. Despite being among the youngest performers,
they lit up the stage with their infectious energy and passion — and was
proudly awarded the <strong>Distinction Award</strong>, the highest accolade,
a school can achieve. What a moment it was!</p>
<p>Since then, Modern Dance has evolved into a vibrant CCA open to both boys
and girls. Today, our dancers groove to a variety of genres including <strong>modern dance, hip hop, K-pop, and street dance</strong>,
honing not just their moves but also their <strong>confidence, discipline, and teamwork</strong>.</p>
<p>Modern Dance at Frontier is more than just choreography and rhythm — it’s
about expression, unity, and growing together as passionate performers.</p>

<p><strong>Build Confidence &amp; Self-Expression<br></strong>Learn to express
yourself through a variety of dance styles — from graceful modern movements
to high-energy hip hop and K-pop beats!</p>
<p><strong>Master Dance Techniques<br></strong>Pick up essential dance skills
and grow as a performer, whether you’re dancing solo or moving in sync
with your crew.</p>
<p><strong>Learn Teamwork &amp; Discipline<br></strong>Discover the true
meaning of unity, commitment, and respect as we practise, perform, and
grow together as a team.</p>
<p><strong>Shine on Stage!<br></strong>Get ready to dazzle in performances
such as the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation, school celebrations
like Chinese New Year, and even external showcases!</p>
