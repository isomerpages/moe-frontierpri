<td width="177"><strong>CCA Information:</strong></td>
<td width="425">
<p>Modern Dance, formerly known as DanzWhiz, started out as special talent identification programme for lower primary boys. After participating in an audition and undergoing a talent dance programme, these boys were shortlisted to represent Frontier Primary School in the 2016 Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation for Dance (International Dance) category. Through their hard work and determination, they clinched the Distinction Award, the highest accolade for the school. They were amongst the youngest participants and had won the hearts of many with their contagious energy and passion while they were dancing on the stage.</p>
<p>Presently, it has evolved to a CCA where members come to explore the various genres and dance techniques of modern dance, hip hop and street dance while learning about confidence, discipline and teamwork.</p>
