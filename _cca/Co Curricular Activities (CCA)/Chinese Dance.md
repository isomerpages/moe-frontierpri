<td><strong>CCA Information:</strong></td>
<td>
<p>The Chinese Dance CCA started in 2013 and aims to provide a tactile experience for students to be engaged in fun dance training and to encompass learning in a creative way, cultivate a love and an appreciation for the aesthetics, help students better appreciate the cultural significance behind cultural dances and elements in dance, and help students develop better motor skills and showmanship through dance and movement and performance/competition opportunities. Most importantly, it helps students understand and appreciate the importance of teamwork.</p>
<p>Students will also be training for SYF Arts Presentation biennially. It is a presentation platform where students showcase their dance performances and get recognition for it. The dance troupe has represented the school in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP) thrice, in 2014, 2016 and 2018 and has attained the &ldquo;Distinction&rdquo; all three times. They have also represented the school in various community performances and in international events like the Singapore International Campus Arts Festival (SICAF) held at Victoria Theatre in 2015.</p>
