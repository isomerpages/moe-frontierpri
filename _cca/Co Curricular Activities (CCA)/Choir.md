<p>The Frontier Choir began in January 2016 with the primary aims of promoting
choral awareness and providing a platform for students with beautiful voices
to showcase their talents. The Frontier Choir believes that music and singing
are integral to promoting well-being, for it is often heard the phrase
that “music soothes the soul”. Our choristers aim to master a variety of
vocal techniques and various repertoires including songs from different
musical periods and countries.</p>
<p>The Frontier Choir is guided by the two main values of self-discipline
and team spirit. In order to succeed, choristers need to exert self-discipline
in the carrying out of various tasks, in the taking charge of one’s own
learning and in being willing to practice vocal techniques on one’s own
beyond formal practice sessions. Also, as choristers sing in a group and
not individually, team spirit is necessary to ensure that everyone sings
his / her part right and we all sound good together. The Frontier Choir
is thankful for eight good years thus far and is looking forward to making
a difference by bringing more joy and laughter to everyone through our
good music this year.</p>
