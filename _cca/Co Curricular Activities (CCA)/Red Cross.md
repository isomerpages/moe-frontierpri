<p>Red Cross Youth (RCY) is a co-curricular activity (CCA) that integrates
character-building, leadership, essential lifesaving skills and blood donation
knowledge, local community service and overseas humanitarian projects in
its curriculum, with the Red Cross ethos and service to humanity as a core
focus.</p>
<p>RCY strives to instill the Red Cross Youth spirit and strengthen core
values such as compassion, passion and professionalism in all members.
By participating in providing Singapore Red Cross humanitarian services,
Red Cross Youths are groomed to become good citizens with a strong sense
of civic responsibility. They are trained to be adaptable, resilient and
confident team players.</p>
