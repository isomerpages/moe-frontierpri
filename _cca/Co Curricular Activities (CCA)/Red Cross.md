<p>Frontier Primary Red Cross was established in 2015, we aim to combine
character-building, leadership, essential lifesaving skills, blood donation
knowledge and local community service in its curriculum. Incuded in the
curriculum is the Red Cross ethos and service to humanity as a core focus.
Members visit Home for the Disabled to show cares and concerns and bring
joy and happiness to the needy, underprivileged and handicapped. Members
will also involve in various VIA programme such as Litter Picking, Mozzie
Wipe and many more, to build up member's awareness in how to contribute
back to society on the best of their ability. We want to bring the best
out of our members and prepare them to be a leader in their families and
community. This is in line with MOE's approach in developing the 21st century
competencies for the youngs, focusing on character and citizenship education.</p>
