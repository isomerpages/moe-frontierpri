<p>The school believes that a child needs to be holistically developed well to be able to thrive and succeed in the face of challenges in the uncertain world that they grow up to be a part of. Subjects such as Physical Education, Art, Music and Co-Curricular Activities play a crucial role in imbuing our students with strong fundamentals and values that allow them to be socially mobile and adaptable to changes through their participation and experience in sports and the arts.</p>
<p>We want our Frontierers to grow to be&nbsp;<strong>Confident Learners</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Adaptable Individuals</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Passionate Leaders</strong>, ready to face the rapidly-changing world while demonstrating resilience, empathy, sportsmanship and appreciation for the arts. Imbued with a strong moral compass to guide them in their actions, our Frontierers will make/be that difference.</p>
