<h4><strong>Our Curriculum Objectives</strong></h4>
<img style="width: 60%;" src="/images/mt1.jpg">

The Mother Tongue curriculum aims to make the learning of Mother Tongue Language more enjoyable, and it also aims to equip students with the competencies required in using their Mother Tongue Language to communicate proficiently in everyday life.<br><br>
The Key learning areas would be the building up of the various languages skills that consists of not only Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing Skills but also Spoken Interaction and Written Interaction Skills.<br><br>
The focus for the Lower Primary would be to develop our students’ Listening, Oracy and Reading skills. This will serve as a strong foundation before the developing of essay-writing skills in the upper primary.<br><br>
Civic Literacy and Cultural Awareness will be cultivated alongside with the development of Language Skills, nurturing our students to be Self-Directed Learners who are confident and passionate about their own chosen Mother Tongue Language.

<h4><strong>Reading Programme</strong></h4>

As reading builds the foundation to language excellence, The Rainbow Reading Programme (P1 &amp; P2) and Avid Reader Programme (P3 – P5) is designed to imbue the joy of reading in students from a young age.<br><br>
Our students will collect reading badges based on the number of books read and book reviews completed for P1 and P2, as well as tasks completed for P3-P5 online and on hardcopy. The colour of the reading badges follow the order of the colours of the rainbow starting from purple and ending with red for Rainbow Reading Programme, while P3-P5 will be receiving Gold, Silver and Bronze collar pins according to the number of reading tasks that they have completed. The commencement of the critical reading period encourages students to read deeply, think critically and communicate their ideas clearly and effectively.

<h4><strong>Mother Tongue Language Fortnight &amp; Cross-Cultural Appreciation Programme</strong></h4>
The Mother Tongue Department annually dedicates two weeks to MTL Fortnight, a time for students to immerse themselves in their language and cultural heritage in an engaging and enjoyable manner. These programs have multifaceted goals including fostering cultural understanding, encouraging the appreciation of diversity, and honing communication skills. <br><br>
At the heart of MTL Fortnight are activities such as cultural exchanges, cultural appreciation workshops, and collaborative endeavors, all designed to enrich the experience. Through active participation in these initiatives, students not only deepen their connection to their own cultures but also broaden their appreciation for the diverse cultures represented by the other racial groups.<br><br>

<h4><strong>VIsTA (Values Inspired Through Action)</strong></h4>
<p>There is a saying that goes, “It takes a village to raise a child”. Alongside the development of our students intellectually, we would want our students to be grounded in sound values, having the ability to reason soundly and make the right decision.</p>
<p>The “Di Zi Gui” 《弟子规》 is integrated into our CCE Curriculum. Through the learning of “Di Zi Gui”, we aim to cultivate a sense of filial piety, empathy, righteousness, humility and sound moral judgment in our students.</p>
