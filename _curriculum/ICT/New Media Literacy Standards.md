<h4><strong>Broad outcome</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Manage, create and share digital information respectfully, ethically and responsibly</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">New Media Literacy@Frontier has evolved over the years to remain relevant with the digital networked environment. The lessons are also aligned to our school vision to develop adaptable individuals, confident thinkers and passionate leaders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These lessons include elements of <strong><em>New Media Literacy </em></strong>such as the ability to <strong><em>Create, Connect</em></strong> and <strong><em>Curate</em></strong>&nbsp;information. As seen in the framework by MOE Educational Technology Division (2018), the six core values of the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;CC are in the heart of these interactions which anchor the learning experiences to develop a discerning and responsible user of technology.</p>

<p>The lessons set out to achieve the following objectives. They enable students to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Curate</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>Use digital tools and sound judgement to locate, collect and select information for use in a principled manner</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Use digital creation tools to craft, modify and combine different modes of information (images, audio clips, videos, etc.) to represent and share ideas and/or information.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connect:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Use digital communication tools to participate in the exchange of information or ideas&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Frontier Primary, the lessons are tailored to&nbsp;<u>support curriculum learning</u>&nbsp;of our students across the different levels. The students will undergo various lessons during curriculum in platforms such as IPW and PAL, on how to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operate&nbsp;</strong>computers and applications in ICT-enabled learning environment</li>
<li><strong>Search&nbsp;</strong>for information and communicate over the internet</li>
<li><strong>Create&nbsp;</strong>a word document using Microsoft word</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrate&nbsp;</strong>proficiency in keyboarding skills</li>
<li><strong>Represent&nbsp;</strong>tables of information in Microsoft Excel spreadsheet</li>
<li><strong>Create&nbsp;</strong>a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation with multimedia elements</li>
<li><strong>Operate&nbsp;</strong>peripheral equipment such as recording device</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With these lessons in place, we hope to equip our Frontierers with the appropriate literacies to curate, create and connect with others to enable them to thrive in the new contexts of learning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The platforms are limitless as they now dabble with online tools such as Google Classroom, Padlet and Quizziz. All these platforms allow them to learn at the own pace and learn from one other â€“ through the use of per feedback and collaboration and more importantly, make their thinking visible.</p>
