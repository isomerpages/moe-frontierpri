<p>With the recent relaxation of the Safe Management Measures, our primary 1 students could finally embark on an interdisciplinary learning journey to Thow Kwang Pottery Jungle, with a bus tour around Jurong West and Pioneer. The objective of this field trip is for the students to learn more about their community and appreciate the places of interest around their neighbourhood. They were engaged in some experiential learning in an authentic setting, such as a hands-on pottery-making session and a tour around the Dragon kiln. On top of gaining new knowledge and experiences, they students learnt self-awareness and self-management skills through the activities. It was indeed a very fruitful day for all the students and a highlight in this academic term!</p>
