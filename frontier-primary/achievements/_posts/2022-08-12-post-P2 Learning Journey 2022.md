<p>Finally, after 2 and a half years wait, the Primary 2 students could embark on a Learning Journey to the National Orchid Garden on the 4<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>of August 2022. It was a day of discovery about the story behind our National Symbol Vanda Miss Joaquim and how it represents the resilience of our Nation. Other than learning about difference species of orchids, the students also learned about environmental protection and how we can play apart to ensure a sustainable future for our planet.</p>
