<p>The school will be conducting an emergency exercise in Term 2.&nbsp; This
exercise is part of the SGSecure framework and aims to train the staff
and students in resilience by being prepared for any emergency in the school
premises and&nbsp; to be familiar with the safety and evacuation procedures.</p>
<p>SGSecure is a movement to build the resilience of our community and aims
to sensitise, train and mobilise the community during emergencies.</p>
<p>SGSecure focuses on three core actions that every one of us can do during
emergencies.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong><em>Staying Alert (Vigilance)</em></strong> to prevent and to keep
your family, friends and yourself safe in the event of a emergency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Staying United (Cohesion)</em></strong> through building strong
ties in the community; cherishing and safeguarding Singaporeâ€™s racial and
religious diversity and harmony so that we can stand together in peacetime
and crisis; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Staying Strong (Resilience)</em></strong> by being ready to
deal with a crisis, being resilient as individuals and as a community,
to help each other bounce back quickly after a emergency.</p>
</li>
</ul>
