**Teachers’ Day 2023 Appreciation by Ex Frontierers**


We will be celebrating Teachers’ Day on Thursday, Aug 31, 2023.

In view of the impending Polling Day for the Presidential Election 2023 scheduled on Friday, September 1, 2023, we want to inform you that that the school will not be able to accommodate visits from Ex Frontierers who had planned or were planning to meet with their teachers on August 31, 2023.  This decision is based on the following factors:

1.	The school premises will be required to be cleared and secured between 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM on that day.  This is essential to facilitate the necessary preparations for converting the school into a Polling Station for the upcoming Polling Day.
2.	Many of our teachers and staff members will be actively involved as election workers for the Presidential Election.  On the afternoon of August 31, they are required to report to their assigned election centers for important briefings and duties related to the election.

For Ex Frontierers who wish to express their gratitude to their teachers, you are highly encouraged to fill in the Google Form: https://go.gov.sg/frontier-teachersday  This platform will serve as an alternative way to convey your appreciation.

We sincerely appreciate your understanding, cooperation, and ongoing support.  Your cooperation during this time is greatly valued.

Thank you.
