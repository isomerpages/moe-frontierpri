<p>Dear Alumni,&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Teacher’s Day approaches, we welcome you to return to Frontier on <strong>Thursday, 29 August, between 1 to 2pm</strong>.
This special day is an opportunity to reconnect with your former teachers
and express gratitude towards them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there is also a need to ensure that normal school operations
are not affected. Student and staff safety remains as the school’s priority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that you should be dressed <strong>appropriately</strong> and
your movement is restricted to Canteen only. Our staff will ensure order
in the school, so we appreciate your cooperation. The school reserves the
right to invite uncooperative/disrespectful visitors out of the school
premises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you and we look forward to seeing you!&nbsp;</p>
