We will be celebrating Teachersâ€™ Day on Thursday, 31 August 2023.

To minimize congestion at the gates and for the safety of our students during dismissal, our ex-Frontierers are allowed to enter the school on that day only between  1.45 pm and 2.45pm  via the main gate.  

Upon entering the school, they are required to proceed to the General Office, inform the staff about the teacher(s) they would like to meet, and then proceed to the canteen to wait during this period.  

Ex-Frontierers are to ensure that they are appropriately dressed, either in full school uniform or half school uniform (school T-shirt with school pants/ skirt).  There should be no revealing attire (top or bottom), fanciful hairstyles, hair colours, or visible tattoos on any part of the body.
