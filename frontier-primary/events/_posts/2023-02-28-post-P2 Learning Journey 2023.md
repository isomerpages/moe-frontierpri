<p style=text-align:justify;>On 23 February 2023, the Primary 2 students took their learning beyond their classroom and embarked on a Learning Journey to the National Orchid Garden. It was a day of discovery about the story behind our National Symbol Vanda Miss Joaquim and how it symbolizes the resilience of our Nation.  They were also taught to use questions to collect information/data, processing skills and how to express their thoughts and feelings. Other than learning about the different species of orchid, the students were also given the opportunity to live out to the school’s G.R.E.A.T Culture by being gracious and caring for the environment around them.
