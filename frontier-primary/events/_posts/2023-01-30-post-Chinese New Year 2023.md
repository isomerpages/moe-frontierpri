<p style="text-align:justify;">We celebrated Chinese New Year on Friday, 20 January 2023, with the theme “Forging Ahead with the spirit of Enterprise in the year of the Adventurous Rabbit”. This is a special year as we can finally gather in the hall, together with students from both the Primary and MOE Kindergarten levels to usher in the year of Rabbit as one big family! Besides helping, the mascot for our event, Captain Rabbit to grow his giant carrots, our students also got to learn that with respect, resilience, confidence, and teamwork, we can overcome all challenges and achieve so much more in life.

<p style=text-align:justify;>All Frontierers were also given the opportunity to experience the beauty of Chinese Culture through the integration of the Maker Programme in our classroom activities. They enjoyed the process and brought home many handmade Chinese New Year decorative items. It was indeed a great joy to see Frontierers manifesting the Frontier Spirit during the celebration.

<p style=text-align:justify;>Frontier Primary School would like to continue spreading this joy by wishing all our parents a very Happy & Prosperous Chinese New Year!
