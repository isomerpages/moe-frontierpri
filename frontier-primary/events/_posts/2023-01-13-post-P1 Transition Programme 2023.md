<p style=text-align:justify;>The Primary 1 Transition Programme aims to provide a smooth transition for our Primary 1 students from pre-school to primary school. Through this programme, we equip our Primary 1 students with the knowledge, skills and create opportunities for them to develop the right dispositions to succeed in a new educational setting. This programme also enables them to gain confidence and build a strong foundation to begin their learning in a new school. The students forge new friendship and build quality relationships in their interactions with their peers and teachers. At the end of the programme, our P1 students truly experienced the joy of learning through our customised curriculum.
