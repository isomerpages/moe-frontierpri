<p><strong>Key Approaches</strong>
</p>
<p><u>New Media Literacy Standards</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Integrate</strong> the various new media literacy skills into the
curriculum to make the learning more relevant and authentic for the students.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Most of the lessons will be taught in school whereas some of the tasks
will be for the students to complete at home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is done with the support of and in consultation with the various
department heads so that the skills will be taught meaningfully and with
context, instead of in isolation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examples include email-writing in P5 English and familiarizing with creating
text and including media in Microsoft Word. Some other skills involved
also include collaborating with one another via the SLS platform through
the various tasks assigned (including IPW and post-assembly programmes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of the skill sets involved are not subject-specific – such as being
able to save documents and look up relevant information from reliable and
trustworthy sources. However, some are – such as reading data (in Science)
and digital media exploration (in Art).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Cyber Wellness</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A comprehensive package that encompasses different platforms and avenues
for the students to learn and apply cyber wellness.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>FTGP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assembly talks (differentiated)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage the Cyber Wellness Ambassadors to promote cyber wellness through
creation of short video clips, pamphlets, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HBL tasks for students to engage with their parents at home</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Digital Lifeskills Programme</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The skill sets for the levels have been carefully discussed and chosen
to suit the students’ ability and level of readiness as well as to allow
for progression across the 6 years in Frontier Primary. In 2021, we have
decided to move towards interest-based to move towards a more student-centric
arrangement for the students. Some of these skill sets are also integrated
within the curriculum to allow the transition to be a smoother one for
the students.</p>
