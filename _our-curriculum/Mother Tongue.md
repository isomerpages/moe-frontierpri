<p>The Mother Tongue curriculum aims to make the learning of Mother Tongue
Language more enjoyable, and it also aims to equip students with the competencies

skills that consists of not only Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing

Oracy and Reading skills. This will serve as a strong foundation before
the developing of essay-writing skills in the upper primary.

<p>We have the following programmes to cater to the holistic development
of each child:</p>
<h4><strong>Reading Programme</strong></h4>
<p>As reading builds the foundation to language excellence, The Rainbow Reading
Programme (P1 &amp; P2) and Avid Reader Programme (P3 – P5) is designed
to imbue the joy of reading in students from a young age.
<br>
<br>Our students will collect reading badges based on the number of books
read and book reviews completed for P1 and P2, as well as tasks completed
for P3-P5 online and on hardcopy. The colour of the reading badges follow
the order of the colours of the rainbow starting from purple and ending
with red for Rainbow Reading Programme, while P3-P5 will be receiving Gold,
Silver and Bronze collar pins according to the number of reading tasks
that they have completed. The commencement of the critical reading period
encourages students to read deeply, think critically and communicate their
ideas clearly and effectively.</p>

<h4><strong>Mother Tongue Language Fortnight &amp; Cross-Cultural Appreciation Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The Mother Tongue Department annually dedicates two weeks to MTL Fortnight,
a time for students to immerse themselves in their language and cultural
heritage in an engaging and enjoyable manner. These programs have multifaceted
goals including fostering cultural understanding, encouraging the appreciation
of diversity, and honing communication skills.
<br>
<br>At the heart of MTL Fortnight are activities such as cultural exchanges,
cultural appreciation workshops, and collaborative endeavors, all designed
to enrich the experience. Through active participation in these initiatives,
students not only deepen their connection to their own cultures but also
broaden their appreciation for the diverse cultures represented by the
other racial groups.
