<h5><strong><u>Department's Focus</u></strong></h5>
<p>We believe that every child wants to and can learn. We focus on children’s
needs when designing learning experiences. Laying a strong foundation in
our Frontierers’ numeracy skills is our priority. The Math Department aims
to enable our Frontierers to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>acquire Mathematical concepts &amp; skills for everyday use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive
skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build confidence and foster interest in Mathematics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Key Approaches</strong></h5>
<p><strong>1. Concrete to Pictorial to Abstract (C-P-A) Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>Our teachers create opportunities and space for our Frontierer to explore
and discover the joy of learning. CPA (<u>C</u>oncrete to&nbsp;<u>P</u>ictorial
to&nbsp;<u>A</u>bstract) Approach is used to develop mathematical concepts.</p>

<p><strong>3. Verbalizing Thinking through Mathematics Reasoning and Communication</strong>
</p>
<p>To develop confident problem solvers and communicators in Frontier, students
in Frontier are exposed to reasoning and communication tasks to enhance
their knowledge of key mathematical concepts and competencies. Students
will be given opportunities to discuss and express their thoughts and ideas
in both verbal and written forms. Teachers scaffolds students’ learning
through the use of&nbsp; mathematical language.</p>
<p>Through verbalising the thought processes while tackling reasoning and
communication tasks, students develop the capacities to think logically,
confidently, critically and creatively. This strengthens their<strong> e21CC</strong> -
Critical thinking skills and Communication skills. These dispositions are
important for our Frontierers to lead a productive life and be life-long
learners.</p>

<p><strong><u>Key Programmes</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1. I’m a S.T.A.R. in Problem Solving</strong>
<br>How do we help our students to facilitate the development of metacognitive
skills during problem solving?
<br>
<br>Frontier Primary school has customized the <strong>STAR Framework (<u>S</u>tudy. <u>T</u>hink. <u>A</u>ct. <u>R</u>eflect) </strong>which
helps to:
<br>• to guide students to monitor and regulate their thinking.
<br>• enable our students to pause frequently and use the question prompts
to guide them in problem solving
<br>• create the awareness and to regulate our students’ thinking.</p>
<p>The STAR Framework in problem solving is explicitly taught to the students.
It acts as a checklist to guide students’ actions which encourages them
to take ownership of their learning as they engage in self-reflection.</p>
<p><strong>2. <u>Provision of Opportunities through Talent Management</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Math Stretch Programme is conducted for selected Primary 3 to Primary
5 Frontierers who have a strong foundation in Mathematics. These enrichment
programmes aim to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To stimulate and develop Frontierers’ creative thinking and problem solving
abilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To enhance flexibility in Frontierers’ thinking and to expand their horizon
that Mathematics learning is fun, exciting and challenging through a framework
of problem solving approach</p>
</li>
</ul>
