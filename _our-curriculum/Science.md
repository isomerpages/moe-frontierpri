<p><strong>As Science Teachers, we are Leaders of Inquiry in the Science classroom. We seek to:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>create a safe learning environment that will encourage and challenge our
students to develop their sense of inquiry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impart excitement and value of science to students, facilitate and role
model inquiry process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Holistic Science Education</strong>
</p>
<p>In line with the revised Primary Science Syllabus by the Ministry of Education
(MOE), our school designs a range of learning experiences aimed at cultivating
21st-century competencies in our students. More than just mastering scientific
concepts, we prioritise nurturing our students' capacity to apply scientific
knowledge in real-life situations. This educational approach encourages
students to establish connections between scientific principles and their
broader implications for the community around them.</p>
<p>To cultivate critical and adaptive thinking, students are provided with
opportunities to actively engage in scientific practices such as experimentation
and critical inquiry. Through these experiences, they not only participate
in the scientific process but also collaborate with their peers, refining
their problem-solving skills and analytical thinking.</p>
<p>Beyond the pursuit of knowledge, we also hope to instill a sense of responsibility
and foster values, ethics, and attitudes in our students.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Experiences In Frontier Eco-Wonders</strong>
</p>
<p>The Frontier Eco-Wonder&nbsp; is a vibrant outdoor learning space filled
with diverse biodiversity, from colourful flowers to freshly grown vegetables.
The garden fosters curiosity and facilitates a deeper understanding of
scientific concepts as Frontierers explore and learn more about the interconnectedness
of our natural environment through observation and hands-on experiences.</p>
<p>Besides the rich biodiversity, sustainability features like the solar-powered
windmill, solar-powered aquaponics and hydroponics systems demonstrate
the principles of conservation and resource management. These features
enhance the teaching and learning of sustainability so Frontierers can
deepen our scientific knowledge and cultivate lifelong values of environmental
care and stewardship so that we can make a positive difference and be the
difference in our homes and community.</p>

<p><strong>Other Science progammes and resources:</strong>
</p>
<p>Beyond the science curriculum, students can embark on a captivating journey
of discovery through various enriching programs and learning experiences.
For example, E2K Science offers selected students opportunities for hands-on
experiments and collaborative exploration, fostering a deep love for inquiry-based
learning.</p>
<p>Engaging in science-related competitions such as Singapore Primary Science
Olympiad, Singapore Youth Science Fair, Abbott Young Scientist Programme,
not only sharpens analytical skills but also sparks innovation and creativity.</p>

<p>In addition, our department has also curated resources such as science
videos, games and simulations via our Science Digital Space, making science
concepts accessible and enjoyable. Check out our Science Digital Space
