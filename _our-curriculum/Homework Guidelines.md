with the cooperation and partnership of students and parents. Please refer

<p>Parents are &nbsp;recommended to refer to books such as “<strong>Calmer, Easier, Happier Homework</strong>”
by Noël Janis-Norton. The author of the book suggests that even primary
school children need the discipline of almost-daily work at home or they
will fall behind.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following is a list of some of her suggestions:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The basic rules for homework must first be laid down. Then, as resistance
fades, they gradually become accepted, appreciated, and become habits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start the habit of having your child sit down and do homework every day.
Establish a daily homework schedule because routines reduce resistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not skip homework for two or more days in a row as this can make re-establishing
the homework routine more difficult. One day off a week is the optimum,
so your child can have a day when no thought of work need enter his/her
mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wherever possible, plan for homework to be done at the same time every
day. That way it is predictable and therefore easier for everyone to remember
and accept.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a homework schedule chart and place it in a prominent place. Refer
to it frequently. This will reduce confusion and resistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the school has not set any homework, have your child get a head start
on homework due in a few days, have them revise a topic that is causing
them trouble or get them to practise a skill you think they need to improve
on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
