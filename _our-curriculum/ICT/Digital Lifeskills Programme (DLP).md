<p><strong>Our Mission and Vision</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Digital Lifeskills Programme (DLP) is designed to shape Frontierers
as adaptable designers of their own learning in the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century.
The DLP lessons are structured to expose students to various technology
domains and skill sets at different levels, suitable for their learning.
Students will be able to demonstrate 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century Competencies
through computational thinking and logical thinking skills by the end of
their primary school journey. Through these programmes, students are also
encouraged to think creatively, reason systematically and work collaboratively,
which are essential life skills as they enter the work force in the future.</p>

<p>Primary 2 students will get to learn basic block-based programming as
well as the introduction of Microsoft Word to document some of their reflections
and thoughts throughout the that particulate PAL module. Students in the
middle block will be introduced to Maker Education during P3 SCCA while
the Primary 4 students will try their hands at programming a robot using
intermediate block-based programming. The students in the upper block will
be involved in learning basic and intermediate coding, where they will
learn to program a machine and creating their own simple applications.</p>
