<p><strong>Key Approaches</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Digital Literacy</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Digital Literacy (DL) is defined as a set of knowledge, skills and dispositions
that would help our Frontierers to be confident, critical and responsible
users of digital technologies for information, communication and problem-solving.
The Find, Think, Apply, Create (FTAC) framework for DL was introduced when
New Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched in 2020. Students will
acquire digital skills across four components in the FTAC framework.</p>
<p>As part of the Edtech Masterplan 2030, the FTAC framework is unpacked
into nine Digital Competencies (DCs) to support deepening of digital literacy
in schools. These nine DCs will be developed from general education through
post-secondary and higher education, and in the workforce. The development
of the DCs will equip students with the abilities to Find, Think, Apply
and Create effectively in a digitalised environment.</p>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Integrate</strong> the various new media literacy skills into the
curriculum to make the learning more relevant and authentic for the students.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Most of the lessons will be taught in school whereas some of the tasks
will be for the students to complete at home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is done with the support of and in consultation with the various
department heads so that the skills will be taught meaningfully and with
context, instead of in isolation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examples include email-writing in P5 English and familiarizing with creating
text and including media in Microsoft Word. Some other skills involved
also include collaborating with one another via the SLS platform through
the various tasks assigned (including IPW and post-assembly programmes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of the skill sets involved are not subject-specific – such as being
able to save documents and look up relevant information from reliable and
trustworthy sources. However, some are – such as reading data (in Science)
and digital media exploration (in Art).</p>

</ul>
<p>Broad outcomes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Pupils will be learners who are safe, respectful and responsible in the
use of information and communication technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pupils will be equipped with sound values and social-emotional competencies
to navigate their use of cyberspace.</p>

<p><strong><u>Digital Lifeskills Programme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our Digital Lifeskills Programme (DLP) is designed to shape Frontierers
as adaptable designers of their own learning in the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century.
The DLP lessons are structured to expose students to various technology
domains and skill sets at different levels, suitable for their learning.
Students will be able to demonstrate 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century Competencies
through computational thinking and logical thinking skills by the end of
their primary school journey. Through these programmes, students are also
encouraged to think creatively, reason systematically and work collaboratively,
which are essential life skills as they enter the work force in the future.</p>

<p>Primary 2 students will get to learn basic block-based programming as
well as the introduction of Microsoft Word to document some of their reflections
and thoughts throughout the that particulate PAL module. Students in the
middle block will be introduced to Maker Education during P3 SCCA while
the Primary 4 students will try their hands at programming a robot using
intermediate block-based programming. The students in the upper block will
be involved in learning basic and intermediate coding, where they will
learn to program a machine and creating their own simple applications.</p>
