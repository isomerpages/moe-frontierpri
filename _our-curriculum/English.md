<h5><strong>Key Approaches</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>STELLAR</em></strong>  <em>(</em><strong><em>S</em></strong><em>trategies for&nbsp;</em><strong><em>E</em></strong><em>nglish&nbsp;</em><strong><em>L</em></strong><em>anguage&nbsp;</em><strong><em>L</em></strong><em>earning and&nbsp;</em><strong><em>R</em></strong><em>eading)</em> is
an English Language instructional programme adopted at all levels in Frontier
Primary School. The STELLAR 2.0 vision is to nurture children who love
reading and have a strong foundation in the English Language. This will
be achieved by:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. strengthening our students’ language
and reading skills
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. promoting a positive learning attitude</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 30%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Stellar.png">
</div>
<p>Students are immersed in language learning and are exposed to a variety
of genres that are engaging and age-appropriate. The use of different strategies
and pedagogies with explicit instruction, as well as enriching language
experiences, allow our students to appreciate the language within and beyond
the classrooms.</p>
<p>As students progress across the levels, they learn to make the transition
from learning to read to reading to learn. They are eased into reading
silently as well as reading longer texts without visual support. Teachers
continue to provide students with guidance in the processes of planning,
writing and reviewing before they apply these skills in writing independently.</p>
<p>Students are also given differentiated support at various points of instruction
to optimise their learning. Teachers carry out <strong><em>Differentiated Instruction</em></strong> by
designing appropriate activities to support, reinforce and extend their
learning. They also harness <strong><em>e-Pedagogy</em></strong> design learning
experiences that enhance student engagement, subject mastery and help students
acquire and strengthen their 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century Competencies<em>.</em>

<p><strong>EdTech in EL</strong>
</p>
<p>The EL department harnesses and leverages technology to enhance teaching
and learning. The teachers use the <strong><em>Think, Tech, Grow</em></strong>  <strong><em>@ Frontier</em></strong> schoolwide
learning approach to:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>promote and deepen students’ thinking process;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>design tech-enabled learning experiences; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide feedback to students for their growth in learning</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We aim to build strong fundamentals in our students with digital literacy
and technological skills to prepare them for a technology-transformed world.</p>

<h5><strong>Excel@Frontier – English Language Stretch Programme</strong></h5>

to challenge themselves further through the participation of external oratorical
and writing competitions and assuming the role of an emcee during school

<p><strong>1. Learning Support Programme<br></strong>The Learning Support
Programme (LSP) is an MOE-initiated programme which aims to provide early
intervention and support for selected Primary 1 and Primary 2 students
in their learning. The objective of LSP is to equip students with basic
literacy skills so that they can access learning in the regular classroom.
These lessons are conducted in small groups daily during school curriculum
hours by a trained Learning Support Coordinator (LSC).</p>
<p><strong>2. School-based Dyslexia Remediation<br></strong>The School-based
Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) programme aims to provide support for Primary
3 and Primary 4 students who have been identified through a systematic
screening process for dyslexia conducted at the end of Primary 2. This
programme seeks to enable the selected students to acquire coping strategies
in reading so that they will be better able to cope with their learning
in school. Teachers will use a systematic set of strategies and activities
which have been carefully designed by MOE in this programme.</p>
<p><strong>3. Reading Remediation Programme<br></strong>The Reading Remediation
Programme (RRP) aims to provide support for Primary 3 and Primary 4 students
who face consistent difficulty in reading despite having completed the
Learning Support Programme in Primary 1 and Primary 2. This MOE-initiated
programme exposes students to a range of strategies for reading comprehension
which will enable them to recognise words and read grade-level texts with
fluency and comprehension.</p>
