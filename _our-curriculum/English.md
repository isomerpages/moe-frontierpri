<h5><strong>Key Approaches</strong></h5>
<p><strong><em>STELLAR</em></strong>  <em>(</em><strong><em>S</em></strong><em>trategies for&nbsp;</em><strong><em>E</em></strong><em>nglish&nbsp;</em><strong><em>L</em></strong><em>anguage&nbsp;</em><strong><em>L</em></strong><em>earning and&nbsp;</em><strong><em>R</em></strong><em>eading)</em> is
an English Language instructional programme adopted at all levels in Frontier
Primary School. The STELLAR 2.0 vision is to nurture children who love
reading and have a strong foundation in the English Language.</p>
<p>This will be achieved by:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. strengthening our students’ language
and reading skills
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. promoting a positive learning attitude</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Stellar_2.jpg">
</div>
<p>Students are immersed in language learning and are exposed to a variety
of genres that are engaging and age-appropriate. The use of different strategies
and pedagogies with explicit instruction, as well as enriching language
experiences, allow our students to appreciate the language within and beyond
the classrooms.</p>
<p>As students progress across the levels, they learn to make the transition
from learning to read to reading to learn. They are eased into reading
silently as well as reading longer texts without visual support. Teachers
continue to provide students with guidance in the processes of planning,
writing and reviewing before they apply these skills in writing independently.</p>
<p>Students are also given differentiated support at various points of instruction
to optimise their learning. Teachers carry out <strong><em>Differentiated Instruction</em></strong> by
designing appropriate activities to support, reinforce and extend their
learning. They also harness <strong><em>e-Pedagogy</em></strong> design learning
experiences that enhance student engagement, subject mastery and help students
acquire and strengthen their emerging 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies
such as Collaboration, Communication and Information skills<em>.</em>

<br><strong>EdTech in EL</strong>
</p>
<p>The EL department harnesses and leverages technology to enhance teaching
and learning. &nbsp; The teachers use the Think.Tech.Grow school-wide teaching
and learning framework to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>promote and deepen students’ thinking processes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>design tech-enabled learning experiences; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide feedback to students for their growth in learning</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We aim to build strong fundamentals in our students with digital literacy
and technological skills to prepare them for a technology-transformed world.</p>

<p><strong>Buddy Reading Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>This programme supports emergent readers in Primary 2 to help them improve
their reading skills. A group of Primary 4 Frontierers with good reading
and speaking skills, driven by their interest to serve and contribute,
will engage and motivate their juniors in reading twice a week in the morning
before the flag-raising ceremony. These Primary 4 Frontierers exercise
student agency by acting responsibly and contributing actively to help
improve the reading proficiency level of their juniors.</p>

<p><strong>Write@Frontier - Inkredibles Creative Writing Competition</strong>
</p>
<p>The EL department organised the annual<sup> </sup>Inkredibles Creative
Writing Competition during the June school holidays in 2024 to encourage
and inspire our Primary 2 to 5 Frontierers to unleash their creativity
and showcase their flair in writing. This competition aims to provide a
meaningful activity for our students and promote student agency in them.
A total of 25 Frontierers were affirmed for their excellent pieces of writing.
We look forward to receiving more creative submissions in 2025!</p>

<h5><strong>Excel@Frontier – English Language Stretch Programme</strong></h5>
<p>The English Language Stretch Programme aims to develop our students to
become empathetic communicators, discerning readers and creative inquirers.
Selected Primary 4 and Primary 5 students participate in challenging activities
in Oracy, Writing and Literature to hone and sharpen their language skills.
This programme also provides our students opportunities that allow them
to challenge themselves further through the participation of external oratorical
and writing competitions organised by GEB, and assuming the role of an
emcee during school events. Some of them also participate in a Cluster
Partnership programme where they will be able to exchange ideas and learn
from like-minded students from schools within the cluster.</p>

<p><strong>1. Learning Support Programme<br></strong>The Learning Support
Programme (LSP) is an MOE-initiated programme which aims to provide early
intervention and support for selected Primary 1 and Primary 2 students
in their learning. The objective of LSP is to equip students with basic
literacy skills so that they can access learning in the regular classroom.
These lessons are conducted in small groups daily during school curriculum
hours by a trained Learning Support Coordinator (LSC).</p>
<p><strong>2. School-based Dyslexia Remediation<br></strong>The School-based
Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) programme aims to provide support for Primary
3 and Primary 4 students who have been identified through a systematic
screening process for dyslexia conducted at the end of Primary 2. This
programme seeks to enable the selected students to acquire coping strategies
in reading so that they will be better able to cope with their learning
in school. Teachers will use a systematic set of strategies and activities
which have been carefully designed by MOE in this programme.</p>
<p><strong>3. Reading Remediation Programme</strong>
<br>The Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) aims to provide support for Primary
3 and Primary 4 students who face consistent difficulty in reading despite
having completed the Learning Support Programme in Primary 1 and Primary
2. This MOE-initiated programme exposes students to a range of strategies
for reading comprehension which will enable them to recognise words and
read grade-level texts with fluency and comprehension.</p>
