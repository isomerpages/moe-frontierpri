<p><strong>Key Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>Frontier Primary School (FPS) adopts a school-wide approach in creating
a caring and enabling environment to meet students’ needs. Our school lays
the foundation that supports learning by paying more careful attention
to relationship building (e.g. the quality of Teacher-Student Relationship,
Peer Relationship) in order to build resilience, develop character, citizenship
and future readiness in Frontierers.</p>
<p>Aside from building a caring and enabling environment for Frontierers
to learn at FPS through relationship building, we aspire to develop Frontierers
to be Confident Thinkers, Adaptable Individuals and Passionate Leaders
with good character through the CCE fundamental building blocks. Based
on the three big CCE ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices, these
fundamental building blocks comprise the learning of core values, social
and emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions. The CCE fundamental
building blocks at Frontier include subjects like Form Teachers Guidance
Period (FTGP), CCE MT / NTIL, Social Studies as well as learning experiences
like commemorating four National Education events, Values in Action (VIA)
activities and assembly programmes linked to CCE outcomes.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Programmes &amp; Activities</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Frontier Footprints&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>The Frontier Footprints was constructed in 2022 to enable the school to
equip students with an understanding of the history of FPS so as to build
a sense of belonging in them. The P1 to P6 Frontier Heritage Explorer immersive
learning experiences, which are interactive in nature, centers on the three
big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices, serves to enrich students’
learning through an authentic learning experience and innovative content.
Through a strengthened sense of identity at the end of six years, FPS aspires
to empower students to make a difference to the school and community.</p>

<p><strong>Gratitude @ Frontier&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Gratitude is seen as antidote to happiness. The practice of gratitude
has entailed a host of benefits which include a greater sense of well-being,
better relationships with others and build resilience in the long run.
Hence, FPS promoted the practice of gratitude as part of sustaining a positive
school culture. Our teachers champion gratitude explicitly via a multitude
of teaching modes and themes. Our students are led in numerous interactive
ways at the school and classroom level to reflect and express their gratitude.</p>
<p>At the yearly Parent-Child-Teacher Conference (PCTC), gratitude corners
are set up in the school on the actual day of PCTC. Parents are invited
to partake in one of our gratitude practices by writing gratitude notes
to any school staff. The school’s PCTC session thus becomes a more meaningful
one that is filled with abundance of appreciation and warmth.</p>

<p><strong>Embrace SG Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Embrace SG Programme is a programme catered for Permanent Residents (PR)
and International Students (IS) studying in the school. This programme
provides an opportunity for the PR and IS to bond with their Singaporean
peers and share their perspective of living in Singapore to their peers
on how they can make Singapore a home away from home for them. To help
students forge meaningful relationships to create a sense of belonging,
this programme consists of a comprehensive year-long engagement that includes
bonding activities like learning journeys as well as workshops for the
PR, IS and their Singaporean buddies.</p>

<p><strong>Internationalisation efforts @ Frontier&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Interacting with children beyond Singapore is an excellent opportunity
for character building and each year, a group of Primary 4 Frontierers
in FPS are given the chance to be exposed to the global environment and
to become culturally savvy. Through our existing partnerships with overseas
schools like Santa Laurensia Elementary School, our students have been
hosting children from Indonesia. This partnership has continued even during
the COVID-19 pandemic through virtual means. Such experiences have heightened
their social awareness and develop in them a sense of rootedness to Singapore.
The rationale of the programme is to instill a sense of cross-cultural
awareness in our students and also to enable them to create good working
and social relationships with people of other cultures.&nbsp;</p>
