<p><em>"I believe in having a growth mind set. My classroom should be a safe, caring community where children are able to speak their mind, blossom and grow. Teaching is a process of learning from your students, colleagues, parents, and the community. This is a lifelong process where you learn new strategies, new ideas, and new philosophies. Over time, my perspective may change, and it just means that I have grown and learnt new things."</em>
