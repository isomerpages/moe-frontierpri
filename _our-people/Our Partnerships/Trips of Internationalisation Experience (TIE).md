<u>**Trips of Internationalisation Experience (TIE)**</u><br>
As part of our ongoing efforts to deepen students’ acquisition of 21st Century Competencies (21CC) in working with people from a diverse range of socio-cultural backgrounds beyond Singapore, our school partners with two schools in Asia – Chengdu Haibin Primary School in China, and Santa Laurensia Elementary School in Indonesia – since 2019. Through this partnership, we aim to provide authentic overseas learning experiences for our Frontierers.
