<p><em>&ldquo;Every child is unique with his own strengths, temperaments and needs.&nbsp; The child as a learner is sincere and earnest in his quest for knowledge and excellence. Given the right nurturing care and environment, every child will be able to succeed and contribute in his own ways. A child&rsquo;s success should be celebrated to spur him on and his failure should be forgiven so that he is not afraid to explore and attempt. Thus, each child should be appreciated in his own merits and&nbsp;be encouraged to pursue and excel in his areas of interests and strengths. Every child symbolizes hope for the country and should be cherished, nurtured and developed to become a useful citizen.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>I believe that all children can LEARN, have different INTERESTS and&nbsp;</em><em>STRENGTHS. Frontier&nbsp;</em><em>provides a holistic education to help our students learn for LIFE, be ENGAGED and find PURPOSE in&nbsp;</em><em>learning. We&nbsp;</em><em>inspire our students to Make a Difference and Be the Difference through the practice of our school values of Respect, Care, Responsibility, Integrity, Resilience and&nbsp;</em><em>Loyalty. We&nbsp;</em><em>want to work closely with our stakeholders to serve the needs of our students in the community."</em></p>

<p><em>To quote John Dewey, &ldquo;Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself&rdquo;. Not only does primary school education lay the fundamental foundation to develop children&rsquo;s knowledge, skills, attitudes, and most importantly, values, it provides them with social-emotional learning opportunities for a well-rounded, holistic education. In a school with a G.R.E.A.T culture, I believe that every Frontierer will grow and glow to be an upright citizen, anchored on values and driven by passion and purpose in life to thrive in a digital-rich, diverse and globalised economy.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>The world is changing at an unprecedented pace. We need to prepare our children for the unknown, unseen and unpredictable. I believe the education today is about teaching the right values and giving our students the skills they need to succeed in this new world; and helping them grow the confidence to practice those skills to deal with unpredictability and change, and to overcome any future challenges.&rdquo;</em></p>
