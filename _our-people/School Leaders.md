<p><em>“Every child is unique with his own strengths, temperaments and needs.&nbsp; The child as a learner is sincere and earnest in his quest for knowledge and excellence. Given the right nurturing care and environment, every child will be able to succeed and contribute in his own ways. A child’s success should be celebrated to spur him on and his failure should be forgiven so that he is not afraid to explore and attempt. Thus, each child should be appreciated in his own merits and&nbsp;be encouraged to pursue and excel in his areas of interests and strengths. Every child symbolizes hope for the country and should be cherished, nurtured and developed to become a useful citizen.”</em></p>

<p><em>My beliefs in learning are anchored on the conviction that every child possesses unique potential. I champion an inclusive and student-centred approach, and believe that a nurturing and enabling environment guides each child to strive and thrive.

Through a holistic education that fosters academic, social and emotional development, every child will be able to extend the frontiers of their potential and make a difference by effecting a positive change in themselves and others. This is what Frontierers are – confident thinkers, adaptable individuals and passionate leaders.</em></p>

<p><em>The world is changing at an unprecedented pace. We need to prepare our children for the unknown, unseen and unpredictable. I believe the education today is about teaching the right values and giving our students the skills they need to succeed in this new world; and helping them grow the confidence to practice those skills to deal with unpredictability and change, and to overcome any future challenges.”</em></p>
