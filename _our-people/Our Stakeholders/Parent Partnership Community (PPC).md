The PPC serves in multiple roles to support the school's efforts to educate and care for our students and it was built to be a strong parental collaboration between the School, Parents and Students. The schoolâ€™s primary contact with the PPC is via the PPC Executive Committee (EXCO), formed by a few parents within the PPC.

We are constantly welcoming passionate parents coming onboard our PPC family to share information, share experiences and contribute ideas in partnering the school for the betterment of our students. Parent volunteers will have chances to interact with the teachers and students while holding meaningful school events and activities.
