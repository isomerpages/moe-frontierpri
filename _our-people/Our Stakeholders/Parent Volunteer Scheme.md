<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Parent Volunteer Scheme at Frontier Primary School for Primary One Registration (Phase 2B) in 2023</strong></h4>
<p>The objective of the Parent Volunteer Scheme is to facilitate interested parents&rsquo; registration of their child in Frontier Primary School while developing a long-term involvement and commitment with the school in their child&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Under this scheme, parents may register their child under Phase 2B during the Primary One Registration Exercise if the following conditions are met:</li>
<li>a) The child is a Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident</li>
<li>b) The child was born in&nbsp;<strong>2017</strong>and due for P1 Registration in&nbsp;<strong>2023</strong></li>
<li>c) The parent has joined the school as a parent volunteer and has contributed at least 40 hours of voluntary service to the school by&nbsp;<strong>30 June 2023</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Note however that eligibility for registration under Phase 2B does not guarantee your child a place in Frontier Primary School. For more details about Phase 2B eligibility, please refer to the MOE website at&nbsp;https://beta.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration/registration-phases-key-dates/</p>
