Parent Volunteer Scheme at Frontier Primary School for Primary One Registration (Phase 2B) in 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The objective of the Parent Volunteer Scheme is to facilitate interested parents’ registration of their child in Frontier Primary School while developing a long-term involvement and commitment with the school in their child’s journey.

2.   Under this scheme, parents may register their child under Phase 2B during the Primary One Registration Exercise if the following conditions are met:
    
 a)     The child is a Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident
    
 b)    The child was born in **2017**and due for P1 Registration in **2023**
    
 c)     The parent has joined the school as a parent volunteer and has contributed at least 40 hours of voluntary service to the school by **30 June 2023**
    

Note however that eligibility for registration under Phase 2B does not guarantee your child a place in Frontier Primary School. For more details about Phase 2B eligibility, please refer to the MOE website at https://beta.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration/registration-phases-key-dates/

3.  Applications are open **between 1 January 2022 to 30 April 2022** only.
    
4.   Applications that are incomplete and/or received after the closing date will not be accepted.
    
5.   Acceptance of your application does not imply automatic selection; Parent Volunteers are selected solely based on the needs of the school.
