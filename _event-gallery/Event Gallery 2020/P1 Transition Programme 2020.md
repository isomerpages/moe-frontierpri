<p>The Primary 1 Transition Programme 2020 was specially tailored to welcome our new Frontierers. The programme will give them time to transit into the new learning environment. During these 5 days, our Primary 1 pupils went through various activities to get to know the school, their teachers, make new friends and familiarise with new school and class routines.</p>
<p>Their parents were also involved in the programme for them to get to know the school better. They were also able to see their child during the first day of recess and how they experience the process of queuing to buy their food and pay for them. They were also invited to witness their child&rsquo;s class performance on the last day of the transition programme. Overall, it was an enjoyable and fulfilling experience for our new Primary 1 pupils!</p>
