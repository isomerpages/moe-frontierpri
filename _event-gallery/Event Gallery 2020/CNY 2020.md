<p>On 24<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Jan, the school celebrated Chinese New Year. This year, the school has inserted new element into the annual Chinese new year classroom decoration competition. We aligned it with our school value, anchoring on Aesop&rsquo;s Fable----The Lion and The Mouse to bring out Gratitude. Many pupils expressed their gratitude towards family, teachers, and friends through notes of thanks on their decoration.</p>
<p>This year, we also have specially crafted classroom activities which enable pupils to immerse in the Chinese culture, at the same time bring home souvenirs of the Art Works they have created.</p>
<p>After which, all pupils proceed to the hall for celebration, which attributes &ldquo;Growth Mind-set&rdquo; and &ldquo;Integrity&rdquo; are reinforced through skit put up by teachers, Speech &amp; Drama performance put up by P2 pupils and Song &amp; Dance performance performed by MK children.</p>
<p>The concert ended up with everyone&rsquo;s favourite----Lion Dance. Mrs Chua, on behalf of the school, received blessings from the Lions.</p>
