<p>I am privileged to be appointed the 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;Principal of Frontier
Primary School with effect from 15 Dec 2017.</p>
<p>As a school, we are guided by our Philosophy to build <strong><em>Strong Fundamentals for Future Learning</em> </strong>so
that we could develop Frontierers to be<strong> Confident Thinkers, Adaptable Individuals and Passionate Leaders.</strong> Thus,
our Applied Learning Programme, <strong><em>Nurturing The Thinking F.A.C.E.</em></strong>  <strong>for Tomorrow, </strong>&nbsp;which
incorporates Inter-Disciplinary Project Work, Robotics, Coding and Maker
curriculum, equips Frontierers with Creative, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking
skills to better navigate in the complex world. Our Learning for Life Programme, <strong><em>danceFRONT </em></strong><em>broadens our student</em>s’
horizons to enable them to be aesthetically appreciative, cultured, expressive
and imbibed with the essential values. Our tag line “<strong>Dancers with Life, Frontierers of Life!” </strong>depicts
our aspirations for our students to thrive in the face of life’s challenges
and be able to forge new breakthroughs in their journeys ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a young school, we have made steady progress, developing our students
to be wholesome individuals with tenacity and adaptability. Guided by our <strong><em>Think. Tech. Grow. Teaching &amp; Learning Framework</em></strong>,
Frontier is one of the first schools to onboard the <strong><em>MOE’s EdTech Masterplan 2030</em></strong> and
we will be onboarding <strong><em>MOE’s E21CC</em></strong> in 2025. Supported
by these two powerful directives <em>and our</em><strong><em> 4E Strategy </em></strong><em>which aims to</em><strong><em> Enable, Engage, Enrich and Empower</em></strong>,
our students will learn and thrive with skilful innovative teaching and
values inculcation and within a conducive and enabling school environment.
&nbsp;Under the careful supervision of our committed teachers, our students
are nurtured to blossom to be the best that they could be. We are proud
that while our Frontiers continue to excel beyond the non-academics, their
PSLE sterling results have sustained and surpassed national standards since
2018. Our highly esteemed teachers have been selected to share and present
at the national and international conferences to benefit more educators
locally and overseas. We receive strong support from our Parents Partnership
Community that enhances our mission of care for our Frontierers. In addition
to the School Leaders, the school is also led by a full team of competent
and experienced Key Personnel, Lead Teachers and Senior Teachers.</p>
<p>As we seek inspiration from the windmill that harnesses positive energy
to constantly move forward, I will lead my staff to continue our journey
of forging new frontiers ahead. We will strengthen our competencies while
refining our processes and embark on the quest of further progress so that
the school will grow from strength to strength. For parents who are deciding
on a school that will adequately equip its students to be new future-ready,
you know you can entrust your precious ones with Frontier. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Make a Difference, Be the Difference<br></strong><em>our School Motto that continues to inspire and guide us ……….</em>
