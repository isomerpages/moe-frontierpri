<p>It is with deep humility and a strong sense of purpose that I assume the
role of the 3rd Principal of Frontier Primary School. I am honoured to
build upon the strong foundations laid by my predecessor, Mrs Tonnine Chua,
whose visionary leadership and unwavering commitment brought Frontier to
its next height as a young yet well-established school. Under her stewardship,
Frontier established a clear educational philosophy, strong signature programmes,
and a culture of care and professionalism that continue to guide our work
today.</p>
<p>
<br>At Frontier Primary School, we remain anchored in our philosophy of building
Strong Fundamentals for Future Learning. This philosophy shapes not only
what our students learn, but who they become. Our distinctive programmes
— the Applied Learning Programme, Nurturing the Thinking F.A.C.E. for Tomorrow,
and the Learning for Life Programme, danceFRONT—provide rich and meaningful
learning experiences that prepare every Frontierer to navigate an increasingly
complex and dynamic world with confidence and purpose. Together, these
programmes reflect our belief that education must develop both the mind
and the heart, enabling our Frontierers to thrive in school and beyond.
<br>
<br>A Frontierer is one who embraces challenges, perseveres through setbacks,
and acts with responsibility towards self and others—making a difference
through both everyday actions and collective efforts. Central to our next
phase of growth is a strong emphasis on student agency. We want our Frontierers
to take ownership of their learning, exercise voice and choice, and apply
their strengths to make positive contributions.
<br>
<br>We will continue to work closely with our parents and community partners
to support our students’ learning and well-being, and to build a caring
and inclusive school community where every Frontierer feels a sense of
belonging and purpose. Supported by our dedicated staff, and strong partnerships,
Frontier Primary School will continue to grow as a learning organization
— remaining focused on what matters most: the holistic development of every
child.
<br>
<br>As we journey forward together, our school motto continues to guide us:
<br>Make a Difference, Be the Difference—not only in what we achieve, but
in who we become.
<br>
