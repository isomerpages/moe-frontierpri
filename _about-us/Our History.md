<p style="text-align: justify;">Frontier Primary School was established in 2011. The school is currently located at 20 Jurong West Street 61 and was officially declared open in 2014.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since its early years, the school has regularly engaged parents on their hopes and aspirations for their children. The school has articulated these in its Vision, Mission and Values and continues to make reference to these, along with inputs from internal and external scans, in the conceptualization and design of its learning experiences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a young school with a pioneering spirit, Frontier Primary has made several bold efforts to actualize its philosophy of “Strong Fundamentals for Future Learning”. For example, it implemented its student leadership programme, exemplary Leaders @ Frontier in 2012, when its only students were in Primary One. Its Chinese Dance and DanzWhiz groups also participated in the Singapore Youth Festival when its only members were in the lower primary. Frontier Primary was also one of the first primary schools to have implemented both a Learning for Life Programme and Applied Learning Programme – all within its first five years. It was the first primary school to work with HCA Hospice Care, enabling its students and staff to better empathise with different segments of the local community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2015, MOE Kindergarten@Frontier was set up within the premises of Frontier Primary School to provide affordable quality pre-school education to the local community. In 2018, MK@Frontier became part of the school, enabling a smooth transition from kindergarten to primary education.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After it’s re-envisioning exercise and conversations on culture building,&nbsp; the G.R.E.A.T. (Graciousness, Rigour, Enterprising, Affirmation, Thinking) culture was conceptualised in 2021 to enable students to strengthen and deepen the school's identity, align more closely with the school's vision, mission, and values, and foster a sense of community among the students.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another key area of focus for the school is the refinement and enhancement of the school's Signature programmes. The F.A.C.E. curriculum and framework were expanded from communication skills to include thinking and innovation skills through Experiential Learning, Project-Based Learning as well as Maker@Frontier. The DANCEFRONT curriculum has also expanded to include a fuller kaleidoscope of artistic domains and genres. The enhanced curriculum aims to develop in students a range of skills beyond academic learning, including critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills. By nurturing well-rounded individuals, schools can prepare students to be future ready, taking up challenges of tomorrow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The school also underwent robust infrastructure development leading to the construction of the ALP Room (iMaker Lab), LLP Room (The F.L.Y. Room), Heritage Gallery and the upgrading of the School eLF loft and Frontopia (School Library). Through a caring and enabling environment, the school journeys on to foster academic excellence and holistic development of its students, as well as to provide a diverse learning experience for them.</p>
