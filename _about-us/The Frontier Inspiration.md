<p>Like a windmill that harnesses the changing wind to generate positive
energy, Frontier stands unwavering and thrives in the face of change, grounded
in our philosophy of providing Strong Fundamentals for Future Learning.</p>
<p>The four blades symbolise our 4E strategy to Enable, Engage, Enrich and
Empower by moving in unison to nurture Confident Thinkers, Adaptable Individuals
and Passionate Leaders in our Frontierers.</p>
<p>Inspired by the windmill, Frontierers soar to be the best that we can
be and make a difference wherever we go.</p>
<p>A G.R.E.A.T. Frontier begins here.</p>
