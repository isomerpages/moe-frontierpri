<p>The word &lsquo;Frontier&rsquo; urges Frontierers to dare to forge ahead to achieve breakthroughs in boundaries.&nbsp; Hence we have consciously included the word in our logo to remind us of our aspirations to evolve and expand beyond the status quo.</p>
<p>In the school logo, the student is represented by orange colour to show that our pupils will shine brightly and bring brilliance to their future paths and destinations.&nbsp; They will blaze a trail for our school, community and country.&nbsp; The students will embrace the future with confidence and competence.&nbsp; In our school logo, only the student is represented in orange to show the school&rsquo;s commitment to focus on every child and nurture him/her to the best he/she can be.</p>
<p>How the school intends to realize this aim is by building a strong foundation in Values, Knowledge and Competencies (which are denoted by the grey spheres).&nbsp; These 3 areas will be infused in a dynamic culture of learning.&nbsp; This culture includes a curriculum which is progressive, holistic and attuned to the changing landscape and diverse pupil needs.&nbsp; This culture is also enabled by committed and caring staff.&nbsp; This culture of learning is captured by the green swerve which propels the child towards excellence.</p>
<p>After 6 years of education in Frontier Primary, each and every of our student will shine forth after being nurtured by our caring staff in a dynamic culture of learning strongly grounded in Values, Knowledge and Competencies.</p>
