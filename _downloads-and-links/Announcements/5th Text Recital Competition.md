<p>We are proud to announce that one of our students,&nbsp;<strong>Sun Bo Wei from 5 Resilience 4&nbsp;</strong>came in Third in the Fifth Annual Text Recital Competition (Upper Primary Category). This competition is organized by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL), in collaboration with Anderson Primary School and the Singapore Chinese Teachers Literary Recital Society. The competition aims to raise students&rsquo; Chinese reading proficiency, ignite their love for learning the language, and deepen their understanding behind the connotations, rhythm, and beauty of the Chinese language. There were close to 1300 video entries submitted by both Primary and Secondary students this year.</p>
<p>Minister of State for Education and Chairperson of the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL) Ms Gan Siow Huang officiated the awards ceremony and presented trophies and medals to award winners last Saturday at MOE HQ.</p>
