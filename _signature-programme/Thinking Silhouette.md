<p>Thinking&nbsp;Silhouette&nbsp;is a customised thinking model that helps the school realise our vision of developing our pupils into &lsquo;Confident Thinkers&rsquo;. Each thinking&nbsp;silhouette&nbsp;is a profile of one facet of a person&rsquo;s thinking. When the different thinking&nbsp;silhouettes&nbsp;are aggregated, it shows the person&rsquo;s thinking capabilities or capacities. The six&nbsp;silhouettes&nbsp;include &lsquo;The Curious Explorer&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Positive Inventor&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Sharp Evaluator&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Passionate Communicator&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Intuitive Thinker&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Respectful Ethicist&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Visible thinking routines from Harvard Project Zero have been adopted in the Thinking&nbsp;Silhouette&nbsp;programme. These routines are simple structures with a set of questions or a short sequence of steps that are used across levels and subjects. The routines become the ways in which students go about the process of learning.&nbsp;In using the routines over and over again during curriculum and co-curricular activities such as the Interdisciplinary Project Work, the routines will become part of the classroom and school culture</p>
