<h4><strong><u>Our LOGO</u></strong></h4>
<p>The evolving silhouettes depict the progression and transformation of Frontierers during a 6 years&rsquo; school journey.</p>
<p>Premised on a futuristic view of building Strong Fundamentals for Future Learning, we nurture our students to unleash their potential and transcend boundaries, forging breakthroughs as empowered Frontierers in unchartered waters.</p>
<p>The school colours of green and orange are harmoniously blended with other colours to symbolize the growth of Frontierers as holistic trailblazers who embrace the future with confidence and competence, and shining brightly to illuminate self and others.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Our ALP</u></strong></h4>
<p>Frontier&rsquo;s Approach to<strong>&nbsp;Nurturing the Thinking&nbsp;F.A.C.E&nbsp;(</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>rontierers who are&nbsp;</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>daptive,&nbsp;</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>ommunicative &amp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>mpowered) for Tomorrow</strong>&nbsp;is a consolidation of the school&rsquo;s multi-pronged efforts to infuse thinking as a tool for constructing knowledge and acquisition of the 21CC. Our diverse learning experiences delivered through the ACE (<strong><u>A</u></strong>ccelerate,&nbsp;<strong><u>C</u></strong>onnect,&nbsp;<strong><u>E</u></strong>xtend) Framework drives to support the school&rsquo;s vision of nurturing &ldquo;Confident Thinkers. Adaptable Individuals. Passionate Leaders.&rdquo; Align to the school&rsquo;s vision, learning in our ALP is designed to equip our pupils with the fundamental skills of communication and thinking to brace them for the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century workforce.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Objectives of ALP</u></strong></h4>

<p>Singapore is at the crossroads of a restructuring effort to meet the global demands of a knowledge-based economy. &nbsp;While we focus on nurturing the thinking face for tomorrow so that our students can be confident thinkers, adaptable individuals and passionate leaders, we also empower them with the essential skills through Reflective Thinking.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Stay future-ready: Refreshed Curriculum</u></strong></h4>
<p>With changes to SBA, the use of freed-up curriculum time allows our students to focus on the &nbsp;<em>process of learning</em>. The P3-P5 IPW activities are designed to enable students to learn deeply and apply their knowledge and skills across various subjects and domains.</p>
