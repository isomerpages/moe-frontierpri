<h4><strong>P1 and P2 Programme for Active Learning (PAL)<br /></strong></h4>
<p><strong>UNDERSTANDING&nbsp;PAL</strong></p>
<p>The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) consists of modules of activities in the two broad areas, Sports &amp; Games and Outdoor Education, and Performing Arts and Visual Arts. It is a non-academic programme carried out within curriculum time for all P1 and P2 students.</p>
<p><strong>Philosophy of&nbsp;PAL@FPS</strong></p>
<p>In Frontier, we believe in nurturing the whole child. Our students should be self-directed learners, to be actively engaged in and&nbsp;enjoy&nbsp;what they learn, helping them to be&nbsp;confident&nbsp;persons.&nbsp;They should be&nbsp;socially and emotionally competent&nbsp;in life, enabling them to work well in teams and for interaction and cooperation with others. They should also be&nbsp;creative&nbsp;and&nbsp;innovative&nbsp;individuals who are able to communicate their thoughts and ideas effectively.&nbsp; Our students should have a lively curiosity about the world they live in and have the&nbsp;resilience&nbsp;to cope with ambiguity and adapt well to change. &nbsp;Character and national values should be inculcated in them as guiding principles as they grow up to be morally sound and responsible people who will contribute actively to society.</p>

<p><strong>The Five Characteristics of PAL Modules</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Experiential in nature&ndash; PAL modules are designed to provide students with meaningful engagement through experiential learning in a non-judgemental and authentic environment. PAL provides kinesthetic and tactile experiences that will reinforce students&rsquo; cognitive and conceptual learning. Reviewing and reflection time are included, building confidence in communication.</li>
<li>Encompasses learning in a creative way&ndash; Children are inquisitive and curious learners who enjoy inquiry and want to know more. Providing children with the space within PAL to explore and apply skills, concepts and ideas to new situations will allow them to deepen their learning and enable new self-discoveries.</li>
<li>Provides opportunities for children to create&ndash; Each child is different and expresses creativity in their individual ways. Time and space will be provided during PAL activities for students to create and express their ideas.</li>
<li>Incorporates values education and social &amp; emotional learning&ndash; Through the individual and group activities, students are able to learn about themselves and understand how to better relate to and work with others, which is an important competency to thrive in a fast changing and globalised world.</li>
<li>Fun and Enjoyable&ndash;Students are provided with opportunities to discover the world around them and expand into new areas that are both enjoyable and challenging so that they are able to make connections and appreciate the process of learning.</li>
