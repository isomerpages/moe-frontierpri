**Our Partner â€“ Frontier Community Club (CC)**

In order to instil a sense of responsibility towards the community through authentic learning activities, one of our key partners is Frontier Community Club (CC). In our Primary 1 Learning Journey to the CC, our young Frontierers had a tour of the Jurong West Public Library and learned about the roles that a community club plays in fostering the community spirit within our neighbourhood.

Our students also play their part for the community by supporting and contributing to the recent Hari Raya celebration organised by the CC. We celebrated this festive event together with the community through captivating performances by our Chinese Dancers and Modern Dancers. It was a joyous event as our performances were well received by the public for their upbeat and vibrant dances.

We look forward to continuing our partnership with Frontier CC so as to Make A Difference to our community.
