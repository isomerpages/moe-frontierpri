<u>**Our Partner – Commonwealth Secondary School**</u>

Frontier Primary School has established a partnership with Commonwealth Secondary School (CWSS) since 2020 to enrich our students’ learning in Maker Education. As part of their Values-In-Action (VIA) projects, CWSS Secondary 3 students have been conducting Maker Education workshops such filmmaking for our Frontierers.

In addition, Frontier’s Design and Innovation Club CCA has organised learning journeys to CWSS where our students have the opportunity to visit their d.space (Maker Space) and broaden their learning experiences. Using the equipment and materials provided by CWSS, our Design and Innovation Club students learnt how to use software for 3D modelling and printing to make personalized keychains!

Through all these engaging experiences, our students have acquired valuable skills and mindsets including the Maker mindset, critical and inventive thinking, collaboration and communication. The collaboration with Commonwealth Secondary has indeed created opportunities for our Frontierers to hone their skills in Maker Education and to become young Makers of the future!
