<h4><strong>Broad outcome</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Manage, create and share digital information respectfully, ethically and responsibly</strong>
</p>
<p>New Media Literacy@Frontier has evolved over the years to remain relevant
with the digital networked environment. The lessons are also aligned to
our school vision to develop adaptable individuals, confident thinkers
and passionate leaders.</p>
<p>These lessons include elements of <strong><em>New Media Literacy </em></strong>such
as the ability to <strong><em>Create, Connect</em></strong> and <strong><em>Curate</em></strong>&nbsp;information.
As seen in the framework by MOE Educational Technology Division (2018),
the six core values of the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;CC are in the heart of
these interactions which anchor the learning experiences to develop a discerning
and responsible user of technology.</p>

<p>The lessons set out to achieve the following objectives. They enable students
to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Curate</strong>:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Use digital tools and sound judgement to locate, collect and select information
for use in a principled manner</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Create:</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Use digital creation tools to craft, modify and combine different modes
of information (images, audio clips, videos, etc.) to represent and share
ideas and/or information.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Connect:</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Use digital communication tools to participate in the exchange of information
or ideas&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Frontier Primary, the lessons are tailored to&nbsp;<u>support curriculum learning</u>&nbsp;of
our students across the different levels. The students will undergo various
lessons during curriculum in platforms such as IPW and PAL, on how to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Operate&nbsp;</strong>computers and applications in ICT-enabled
learning environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Search&nbsp;</strong>for information and communicate over the
internet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create&nbsp;</strong>a word document using Microsoft word</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Demonstrate&nbsp;</strong>proficiency in keyboarding skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Represent&nbsp;</strong>tables of information in Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create&nbsp;</strong>a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation with
multimedia elements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operate&nbsp;</strong>peripheral equipment such as recording device</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With these lessons in place, we hope to equip our Frontierers with the
appropriate literacies to curate, create and connect with others to enable
them to thrive in the new contexts of learning.</p>
<p>The platforms are limitless as they now dabble with online tools such
as Google Classroom, Padlet and Quizziz. All these platforms allow them
to learn at the own pace and learn from one other â€“ through the use of
per feedback and collaboration and more importantly, make their thinking
visible.</p>
