<p>Enhancements to Edusave Awards for Achievement, Good Leadership &amp;
Service (EAGLES)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Edusave Awards for Achievement, Good Leadership &amp; Service (EAGLES)
was introduced in 2001 to recognise students' leadership qualities, excellence
in nonacademic activities, and service to community and schools. This yearly
award is open to students who are Singapore Citizens.</p>
<p>With effect from 2024, EAGLES is enhanced to recognise students with consistent
and exemplary demonstration of Emerging 21st Century Competencies (E21CC)
in government/government-aided primary and secondary schools, independent
schools, specialised independent schools, and junior colleges/Millennia
Institute (JC/MI). This is part of the larger goal to prepare our students
to thrive in a fast-changing, complex and inter-connected world, by encouraging
the development and application of future-ready competencies.</p>
<p>[NEW] P1- 3 students must satisfy the following set of eligibility criteria
before he/she can be awarded EAGLES (E21CC):</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Singapore Citizens who attain a conduct grade of ‘Good’ or better;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Demonstration of E21CC in a consistent and exemplary manner as observed
in school settings and contexts (More details on the list of E21CC can
