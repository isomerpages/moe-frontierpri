<u>**Our Overseas Partner – Chengdu Haibin Primary School, China (成都市海滨小学)**</u><br>
As part of our continued efforts to instil in Frontierers an appreciation for the wider international community, our school has been having overseas exchange programme with Haibin Primary School in Chengdu, China since 2019.

Despite the pandemic situation, our school continued this exchange programme by leveraging technology.&nbsp; Our selected students from Primary 5 have collaborated virtually with the students from Chengdu Haibin Primary School yearly, focusing on themes such as a SMART Home and a SMART School while leverage Maker Education.&nbsp;

Through this internationalisation programme, we aim to develop in our students the 21st century competencies of global awareness and cross-cultural skills. In addition, we want to develop communication, creative and innovative thinking skills in our students and imbue creative thinking in them to enable them to visualise, create and solve problems through Maker. Most importantly, it is to develop collaborative skills in our students and to promote a sense of camaraderie with the Chengdu Haibin students.

Through the acquisition of life skills and interaction between our students and students of Chendu Haibin Primary School, we can see our Frontierers growing and truly living up to the School’s Vision of Confident Thinkers, Adaptable Individuals and Passionate Leaders.
