**Our Partner â€“ Land Transport Authority**

As eco-stewards promoting environmental conservation, Frontier Primary has partnered with Land Authority Transportation (LTA) to implement the Car-Lite Programme for our Primary 3 and 4 Frontierers.

Car-Lite Programme aims to create awareness and encourage car-lite behaviour among our Frontierers and their parents with the objectives of promoting environmental awareness and healthy lifestyles. The 2-week programme is run with the support of LTA. During the period, students were engaged through games to achieve the programme objectives. There was also an assembly show where Frontierers had the opportunity to participate in the quiz segments and understand the benefits of creating a car-lite environment.

We believe that through the Car-Lite Programme, we are able to empower our young Frontierers to Make A Difference to our environment.
