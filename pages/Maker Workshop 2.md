<p style="text-align:justify;">“These Maker Workshops are so fun! How I wish I can attend them every week!” exclaimed a P4 student. Frontier Primary has successfully conducted our second 'Maker Workshop' on 24 Feb 2023 and it was favourably received by the students.
	
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this 2nd workshop, students had the opportunity to make handicrafts from moldable polymorph plastic. The process of making was a challenge for most students as getting the correct consistency of the melted polymorph to start the molding process was difficult. However, all the students persisted and every one of them managed to walk away with great pride and their creative masterpieces!

<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at the engaged faces of our Frontierers! Do you want to be one of them? Come and join us for Maker Workshop 3! Listen up for the announcement and register as soon as you can. See you there!
