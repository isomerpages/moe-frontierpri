<u>Our Overseas Partner â€“ Santa Laurensia Elementary School, Indonesia</u>

In a bid to expose Frontierers to the world beyond Singapore, Frontier Primary School has established a close partnership with Santa Laurensia Elementary School (Indonesia) through our Trips of Internationalisation Experience (TIE) since 2019. Despite overseas trips being curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our school has continued to sustain the partnership through virtual exchange to enable our Frontierers to stay connected to the region.

These collaborations have provided our Frontierers with valuable opportunities to increase their foundational understanding of the region when they learn with their overseas peers as well as pick up cross-cultural skills, thereby allowing them to develop character, citizenship and future readiness.
