<p><em>"I believe education is a lifelong journey, and every child can LEARN, ACHIEVE and CONTRIBUTE in their unique ways. I'm grateful for the opportunity to journey together with Frontierers to discover more about themselves, others and the environment around them. As we explore and grow together, I hope Frontierers will develop their strengths, interests and positively impact the people and environment around them."</em>
