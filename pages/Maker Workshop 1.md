<p style="text-align:justify;">Frontier Primary School is proud to conduct our very first Maker Workshop for our students on 30 January 2023, Monday. This workshop aims to develop creative and innovative thinking skills in our students and provide them with the platform to design, experiment and invent in Maker activities. It is heartening to see an enthusiastic sign up rate with full attendance!

<p style="text-align:justify;">In this workshop, students learnt how to make no-sew pouches out of recycled materials under the guidance of our teachers. “Resilience is a value that I learnt during this Maker Workshop. Although it was not an easy task, I did not give up and I am proud of my no-sew pouch!”, exclaimed a P2 student. The students were very engaged during the entire making process and their happy faces showed how much pride they had in making their pouches.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Do look out for our Maker Workshop 2 and sign up as soon as possible due to the limited vacancies! Do not miss the next opportunity!
