<p><em>"There are people who love learning, and there are people who develop the love for learning. The beauty of being a teacher is creating opportunities for students to develop, or further, this love for learning. Every child should be given a safe space to make mistakes and learn from them, building them up to be critical thinkers and movers. I am a firm believer that character-building plays a big part in developing students holistically in this everchanging landscape. Learning can be fun yet challenging!"</em>
