**Our Partner – Lions Befrienders**

Frontier Primary has been partnering Lions Befrienders as part of our Staff Values-In-Action programme. Recognising the impact of COVID-19 on the seniors’ increased need for social connection, the Partnership Committee alongside Lion Befrienders organise interactive activities for our staff to engage the seniors. With the easing of the COVID-19 restrictions this year, we transitioned from online engagements to face-to-face interactions.

In April this year, some of our staff visited the Lions Befrienders Centre at Clementi. The seniors were engaged in batik art activity and casual conversations. The completed batik art works by the seniors were so beautiful! It was a fruitful and meaningful time for all of us!
