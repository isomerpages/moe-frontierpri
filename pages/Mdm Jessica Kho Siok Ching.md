<p><em>"I always believe that every child is creative in their unique way and all we need is to give them opportunities and learning space, along with a caring heart to guide and support them. I also believe that art is more than a subject as it plays a fundamental part in studentsâ€™ character building, instils values through the process of artmaking, develops their critical thinking and decision making which prepare them to be future-ready learners. As a teacher, I not only teach my students, but I also learn from them how they perceive their art world and express their art ideas through their work and reflection."</em>
