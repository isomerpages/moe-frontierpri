<h4><strong><u>Our LOGO</u></strong></h4>
<p>The evolving silhouettes depict the progression and transformation of
Frontierers during a 6 years’ school journey.</p>
<p>Premised on a futuristic view of building Strong Fundamentals for Future
Learning, we nurture our students to unleash their potential and transcend
boundaries, forging breakthroughs as empowered Frontierers in unchartered
waters.</p>
<p>The school colours of green and orange are harmoniously blended with other
colours to symbolize the growth of Frontierers as holistic trailblazers
who embrace the future with confidence and competence, and shining brightly
to illuminate self and others.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Our ALP</u></strong></h4>
<p>Frontier’s Approach to<strong> Nurturing the Thinking F.A.C.E (<u>F</u>rontierers who are <u>A</u>daptive <u>C</u>ommunicative &amp; <u>E</u>mpowered) for Tomorrow</strong> is
a consolidation of the school’s multi-pronged efforts to infuse thinking
as a tool for constructing knowledge and acquisition of the 21CC. Our diverse
learning experiences delivered through the ACE (<strong><u>A</u></strong>ccelerate,&nbsp;<strong><u>C</u></strong>onnect,&nbsp;<strong><u>E</u></strong>xtend)
Framework drives to support the school’s vision of nurturing “Confident
Thinkers. Adaptable Individuals. Passionate Leaders.” Align to the school’s
vision, learning in our ALP is designed to equip our pupils with the fundamental
skills of communication and thinking to brace them for the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century
workforce.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Objectives of ALP</u></strong></h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To enable all Frontieriers to express ideas and thoughts clearly and effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To cultivate and enhance Frontieriers critical and creative Thinking skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide opportunity for Frontieriers to build character and relationships
by influencing interactions positively.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Singapore is at the crossroads of a restructuring effort to meet the global
demands of a knowledge-based economy. &nbsp;While we focus on nurturing
the thinking face for tomorrow so that our students can be confident thinkers,
adaptable individuals and passionate leaders, we also empower them with
the essential skills through Reflective Thinking.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Nurturing Frontierers who are Adaptive, Communicative and Empowered for&nbsp;tomorrow through ALP Structure</u></strong></h4>
<p>In Frontier, we help our students to acquire Communication and Thinking
skills through Experiential Learning via our ALP Lessons that are conducted
weekly. After acquiring the thinking and communication skills, our students
will apply these skills through Project-Based Learning via P3-P5 Interdisciplinary
Project Work (IPW). The skill set acquired is also deepned through Maker
Ed@Frontier.</p>

<p><strong><u>Building of Staff Capacity</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In Frontier, we believe that our staff is the key drivers of the ALP.
To develop a dynamic and inspiring school team, a training road map is
mapped out for our staff starting from building capacity of the Core Team,
to all staff and individual staff. There are various workshops specially
set aside for the facilitation of P3 Maker Ed lessons and IPW lessons.</p>
