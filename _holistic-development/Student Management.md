<p>The school’s student leadership programme, exemplary Leaders@Frontier (eLF), is premised on the belief that ‘<strong>Every Student is a Leader</strong>’ and is designed to achieve the school’s vision of “Passionate Leaders”.</p>
<img src="/images/sll1.jpg">
<p>Student leadership development is deployed through a 3-tier approach:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Baseline leadership training&nbsp;</strong>known as “Class eLF Training” is conducted for all students through level-customized student leadership training packages which aim to equip students with competencies such as self-awareness, empathy and taking initiative. All students are given opportunities to be a Class eLF within the class.</li>
<li>Students who exhibit exemplary leadership qualities and values are selected to become a&nbsp;<strong>School eLF</strong>&nbsp;(S-eLF), to lead at the school. These students are nominated by their teachers and undergo an interview to be confirmed as S-eLF.&nbsp;<strong>Teacher mentors are assigned</strong>&nbsp;to all S-eLF to provide group mentoring.&nbsp;<strong>Regular meetings and trainings</strong>&nbsp;are also conducted regularly to support and develop the S-eLFs. The school<strong>&nbsp;monitors and</strong>&nbsp;<strong>assesses the performance of S-eLF</strong>&nbsp;through self-evaluation, peer­evaluation, evaluation by form teachers and eLF teachers over the course of the year. A 6-year plan for the&nbsp;<strong>progressive development</strong>&nbsp;of the S-eLF knowledge, skills and values is used as the skeleton for all S-eLF trainings</li>
<li>In parallel with S-eLF, students who exhibit leadership qualities in their CCAs are similarly identified for appointments to lead at the CCA level, under the guidance of CCA teachers. In 2019, the school started a CCA Leadership Camp to&nbsp;<strong>develop leadership traits and qualities</strong>&nbsp;through scenario-based opportunities for application. CCA teachers are provided with information on the students’ strengths and AFGs to enable continued development during CCA.</li>
<li>A S-eLF Council has also been formed to&nbsp;<strong>serve the school at a higher level</strong>. The S-eLF Council is voted into the different council positions by staff and the student body. They undergo different trainings and are mentored closely by the S-eLF teachers. The S-eLF Council members will co-plan certain segments of S-eLF-L.E.S.S with the S-eLF teachers. During certain eLF Meet and S-eLF-L.E.S.S, the Upper Primary S-eLF will also facilitate certain segments and guide the younger S-eLF, such as how to be effective in carrying out their duties and how to manage difficult and uncooperative peers.</li>
