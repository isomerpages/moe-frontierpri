<h4><strong>Key Approaches</strong></h4>
<p>The<strong> Student Management Department </strong>&nbsp;plays a vital
role in nurturing our students&nbsp; by creating a safe, supportive, and
values-driven school environment. Its work is central to the holistic development
of every child—ensuring not just academic progress, but personal growth
and well-being.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The department believes in promoting positive student behaviour. We hope
to help our students learn from mistakes, make better choices, and grow
in character.</p>
<p>Premised on the belief that every student matters, our department works
closely with teachers, parents, and student support teams—including SEN
Officers—to provide timely interventions for students who may face behavioural,
learning or social challenges. These efforts ensure that students are not
left behind, but are supported with compassion and understanding.
<br>
</p>
<p>Thumbs Up! Values In Action
<br>
</p>
<p>To enable stronger behavioural demonstration of school values, the school
introduced Thumbs Up! Values in Action! to concretise how it would like
for students to display the school values via specific behaviours. Thumbs
Up! is aligned to our school Motto, Make a Difference and Be the Difference.</p>

<p><u>S.T.A.R. Approach</u> 
<br>
</p>
<p>The school aims to instill in all students the value of self-discipline.
Self-discipline is a life-long value that will serve and benefit them tremendously
as they grow and mature.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>Whenever faced with a difficult situation, students are taught to use
the S.T.A.R. Approach. They should STOP. THINK. ACT. and then REFLECT.</p>
<p>

<br><u>School Discipline </u>
<br>In enacting a positive and proactive approach to discipline in school,
there are three aspects to consider:</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="margin-left:0px;margin-top:0px;" height="190" width="320" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe5_DycSAPiWTx8xtYipeL9D6879uR4aHV6t3hxF1JJF4FpLFcqMH2Qu9VX805pgxPhpcFf8_AM8lrkoVleKOtqHwbORBPXZ4SKdLSUy6yMsFXkRPgV8L73J8sxeTcEf02m0Epk?key=iq8aTdDzoS6mWuAKu9kmjQ">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Promote and Prevent</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe <strong>promoting</strong> a safe and supportive environment
is important. Hence, we emphasize on strong Teacher-Student Relationship
and communicating our school rules and expectations to the students regularly.
By doing so, we hope to <strong>prevent</strong> challenging behaviours from
occurring and disrupting learning.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Address and Correct</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite preventive measures, students could still display inappropriate
behaviours due to various reasons. As educators, we <strong>address</strong> the
inappropriate behaviour promptly so that it does not disrupt teaching and
learning, and <strong>correct</strong> it before it affects students’ development
and well-being.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Replace and Restore</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As the ultimate goal is for students to develop self-discipline and good
character, it is important for teachers to help misbehaving students to <strong>replace</strong> their
inappropriate behaviour with prosocial, appropriate ones, and to <strong>restore</strong> relationships
with others hurt by their actions.</p>

<p><u>Thumbs Up! Affirmation&nbsp; and Model Class Award</u>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At Frontier, we place great importance on student recognition as a key
strategy to foster a strong sense of belonging and to cultivate a positive
school culture. By intentionally highlighting and affirming positive behaviours,
we make expectations clear and reinforce the values we uphold as a school
community.</p>
<p>Our school-level motivational programmes, <strong>Thumbs Up! Affirmation</strong> and
the <strong>Model Class Award</strong>, recognise both individual students
and classes who consistently demonstrate exemplary conduct and positive
attitudes. These recognitions are shared and celebrated at the end of each
term, creating an encouraging and affirming environment where students
feel valued and motivated to do their best.</p>
