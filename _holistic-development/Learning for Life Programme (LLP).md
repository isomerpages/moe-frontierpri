<p>DANCEFRONT is the school&rsquo;s approach to deliver Performing Arts education to Frontierers. Every child will participate in a DANCEFRONT activities customized for their level. The school has selected performing arts as a vehicle to develop SE Competencies and values with the following beliefs:</p>

<li>Performing arts provide the opportunity for social interaction through partnering dances and group performances.</li>
<li>Performing arts develop self-esteem and confidence of participants, as well as self-management from the listening and concentration required during the activity.</li>

<p><strong>OUR APPROACH TO IMPLEMENTING DANCEFRONT</strong></p>
<p>Our approach to implementing DANCEFRONT is similar to the 3Es Approach of&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>njoy,&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>nrich and&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>mpower for PAM. Aligned with the school philosophy of&nbsp;<em>Strong Fundamentals, Future Learning</em>: By providing our pupils with diverse experiences, their view of the world will be expanded, developing them into&nbsp;<strong>adaptable</strong>&nbsp;and appreciative individuals. With every opportunity, our Frontierers will grow to become more&nbsp;<strong>confident</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>expressive</strong>&nbsp;each time they take their performance to the stage.</p>
