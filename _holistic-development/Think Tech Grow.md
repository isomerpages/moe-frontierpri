<p>Thinking Silhouette is a customised thinking model that helps the school
realise its vision of developing our students into ‘Confident Thinkers’.
The visible thinking routines from Harvard Project Zero have been adopted
in Thinking Silhouette. These routines include a set of guiding questions
for our students to frame their thinking process and sharpen their thinking
skills. The application of the thinking routines is carried out consistently
across different curriculum subjects and during co-curricular activities
such as Interdisciplinary Project Work.</p>
