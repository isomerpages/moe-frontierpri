<p><em>"Education is not just about grades: it is about building and nurturing the character of a child. It is also about preparing the child for a changing future. Education should enable the children to grow up to be independent-thinking adults who are resilient in the face of challenges and failure. Education does not stop when school ends: it is a lifelong process."</em></p>
