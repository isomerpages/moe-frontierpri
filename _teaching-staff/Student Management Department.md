<p><em>"I believe in having a growth mind set. My classroom should be a safe, caring community where children are able to speak their mind, blossom and grow. Teaching is a process of learning from your students, colleagues, parents, and the community. This is a lifelong process where you learn new strategies, new ideas, and new philosophies. Over time, my perspective may change, and it just means that I have grown and learnt new things.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>"The mind of a child is a boundless universe of imagination, curiosity and knowledge. I believe in opening up enriching experiences and opportunities to develop a child holistically. In discovering their passion and finding joy in learning every&nbsp;day, they can make their dreams become tomorrow's reality."</em></p>
